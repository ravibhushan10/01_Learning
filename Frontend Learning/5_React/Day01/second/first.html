 <!-- Why react and react-dom code in different-different file not in same file:::

    Because react is used in both web apps and mobile apps
    1: Web Apps: we need both react and reactDOM 
    2: Mobile Apps: we need only react 

    That's why we not combine both together if we combine then it works in webapps well but in mobile apps (reactDOM) added extra code which increase your codebase and slow performance 

    Hence both exist in different-different file
